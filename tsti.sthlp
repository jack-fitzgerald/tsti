{p 4 4 2}{bf:Arguments}

{col 5}{it:Argument}{col 21}{it:Description}
{space 4}{hline}
{col 5}{it:estimate}{col 21}The estimate of interest.
{col 5}{it:se}{col 21}The standard error of the estimate of interest. Must be > 0.
{col 5}{it:rope_lb}{col 21}Lower bound of the region of practical equivalence (ROPE). Must be < rope_ub.
{col 5}{it:rope_lb}{col 21}Upper bound of the region of practical equivalence (ROPE). Must be > rope_lb.

{p 4 4 2}{bf:Options}

{col 5}{it:Option}{col 21}{it:Description}
{space 4}{hline}
{col 5}df({it:real}){col 21}Degrees of freedom of the estimate of interest. If specified, must be > 0.
{col 5}{col 21}Exact (rather than asymptotically approximate) bounds and testing results are produced if this option is specified.
{col 5}alpha({it:real}){col 21}The significance level of the test. Defaults to 0.05. If specified, it must be true that 0 < alpha < 0.5.

{title:Examples}

*Load Natinal Longitudinal Survey of Young Women, 14-24 in 1968, and set up for imputation DID
webuse nlswork, clear
cap ssc install did_imputation
gen year_u = year if union == 1

*Run imputation DID and store effect of obtaining union membership on inflation-adjusted log wages and weekly work hours
did_imputation ln_wage idcode year union_year, fe(idcode year) autosample
local beta_ln_wage = r(table)[1, 1]
local se_ln_wage = r(table)[2, 1]
did_imputation hours idcode year union_year, fe(idcode year) autosample
local beta_hours = r(table)[1, 1]
local se_hours = r(table)[2, 1]

*If we think that the smallest effect of unionization on weekly working hours that is practically meaningful is four hours...
tsti `beta_ln_wage' `se_ln_wage' -4 4

*If we think that the smallest effect of unionization on wages that is practically meaningful is 5%...
tsti `beta_ln_wage' `se_ln_wage' -.05129329 .05129329
*.05129329 = ln(1.05); mathematical expressions must be pre-evaluated as tsti only accepts numerics
